# MusicEd

Work done by Gabby, Ishan, and myself.

Aim of the project was to create a comprehensive and interesting webpage that would provide information to any potnetial Grad Students for the Music Program at Penn State. This was done with bi-weekly meetings with our points of contact with the graduate music program, with progress and work being evaluated consistantly. 
Work was asked to be stopped before the website was fully created, and thus will remain in the current state.
