<button class="accordion"><b>Why Penn State</b></button>
<div class="panel">
  <br><p><b>What were you doing prior to Penn State:</b><br>Over the six years between completing my masters and beginning my PhD, I was a practicing musician, teacher and community organizer. I had 25 private lesson students in Boston, I was a founding member and mentor for School of Honk, community school that taught New Orleans second line music. I was leading an all-women's rock band called Paper Waves. I was producing concerts for my series called Afropop Night Live in Boston. I volunteered with Girls Rock Boston, I volunteered with Afropop Worldwide - writing album reviews and producing podcasts. I worked at a non-profit organizing free music programming for Latino elders at FriendshipWorks, and I directed an after school music program at a non-profit called Hyde Square Task Force, leading a free music program for Latino teens.</p><p><b>What factors influenced your decision to pursue this degree:</b><br>I was ready to do more research in my area of interest: music of the African and Afro Latin diaspora in music education and community music in the United States. The degree will hopefully allow me to teach college, or take on a leadership role in a non-profit, or a research institution.<p><b>Why Penn State:<br></b>I sought to work with Dr. Clements and Dr. Watts whose work overlaps with ethnomusicology, as ethno-educators.<p><b>What is unique about the Penn State graduate music education program:<br></b>It is a progressive program open to ideas and diversity </p></p></p>

<button class="accordion"><b>Current Activities</b></button>
<div class="panel">
  <br><p><b>What do you do to relax and have fun outside of the graduate program:</b><br>I have my own band called Athena and the Night Owls for which I write songs. I go hiking, listen to records, cook, play with my dog, go dancing, take yoga.<p><b>What advice do you have for prospective students regarding the application process:</b><br> Film yourself teaching!</p></p>
