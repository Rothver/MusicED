Music Education –SUNY Potsdam (NY)<br> M.Mus. Music Education –Ithaca College (NY)<br> CAS Educational Administration –SUNY Oswego (NY)<p><b>What were you doing prior to Penn State:</b><br>I was teaching full-time as a 9-12 Choral Music educator. I also was (still am) the Director of Music for the Baldwinsville First United Methodist Church<p><b>What factors influenced your decision to pursue this degree:</b><br>I have always known that I wanted to teach at the collegiate level which typically requires a terminal degree. After conducting some informal research in my own classroom, I fell in love with the research process which cemented my decision to pursue my Ph.D.<p><b>Why Penn State:<br></b>I have started my Ph.D. two other times and Penn State was the first program that felt like “home.” From my first conversation with Dr. Linda Thornton, to my on-campus visit, I knew that Penn State was where I was meant to finish my Ph.D.<p><b>What is unique about the Penn State graduate music education program:<br></b>The small number of people in the program, couple with the number of faculty makes for a lot of opportunities for one-on-one interaction. The requirement for a cognate that is outside of the school of music encourages you to think about other ideas and methods that could impact your work.<p><b>What do you do to relax and have fun outside of the graduate program:</b><br>I enjoy finding timeto just enjoy a meal with the other doctoral students. I make time to play golf.  And believe it or not, commuting home on the weekend to be with my family has become a great source of enjoyment for me.<p><b>What advice do you have for prospective students regarding the application process:</b><br> The application process, including the on-campus visit, is designed not only to help Penn State decide if you are a good fit, but equally as important, to help you decide if WE ARE a good fit. I have done this a couple oftimes, and it is definitely about finding a good fit.<p><b>What tips do you have for being successful in the program:<br></b> Work hard, plan efficiently, and remember that not everything has to be done immediately...if you forget that you will drive yourself crazy.<p><b>Biography:</b></p>
