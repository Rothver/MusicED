				<p><b>What tips do you have for being successful in the program:<br></b> It is essential to continue to have a connection with teaching music and students in order to be successful in the program, in my opinion.  Many times we focus solely on reading, research, and completing bookwork assignments in a graduate program that we lose our ability to grasp what got us here in the first place -being pedagogically sound music educators.  I have found that my ability to continue to teach students, whether it be K-12 students or undergraduates, has allowed me to continue to be grounded and successful in this program.</p>
